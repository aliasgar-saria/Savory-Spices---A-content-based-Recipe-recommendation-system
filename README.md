# Savory-Spices---A-content-based-Recipe-recommendation-system

Developed a content-based recommendation system for Indian food recipes using TF-IDF and cosine similarity. Implemented the solution in a Streamlit app. Tried working on this project for quick, useful recipe recommendations and to learn workings of the recommendation systems.

Still need to work on this, ongoing.
